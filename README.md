Background and introduction:
Chicago is the third most populous city in the United States and also has the highest crime rate compared to less populated areas, where rates tend to be more pronounced. Most crimes are related to the distribution of places, property and people, rather than the patterns of past crimes. This makes it difficult for the Chicago Police Department to improve the accuracy of their crime prediction system.

Our research aims to understand crime patterns and social dynamics in post-COVID Chicago by analyzing the region's crime footprint, ultimately aiding the police department in future crime prediction efforts.

Our goals:
Use different ML methods for prediction problems.
